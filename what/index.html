        <h2>What is Forget Me Lock?</h2>
        <p class="detail"> The average student or working professional has a multitude of tasks to focus on every day, including locking the front door. As common as this task is for those living in apartments in the city, it is often forgotten or becomes a lingering concern. ForgetMe­Lock is a product that provides the user with a piece of mind when struggling to remember whether or not the door has been left unlocked. Including an easy to install module accompanied by a free smartphone application, Forget­Me­Lock will notify you if you're leaving the house and you have left your door unlocked. If the lack of a notification doesn't appease the insatiable feeling of "is my door unlocked?", then a quick check to the Forget­Me­Lock mobile app will show you whether your door is locked or unlocked. Current solutions, known as smart locks, provide the capability to remotely lock a door with a smartphone or to enter with a virtual key. Such solutions are priced from $99 - ­$300 and can be time consuming to install. The problem we have identified is not the inability to remotely lock your door from anywhere in the world, but it is the common, forgetful tendencies of us to leave the door unlocked.  Forget­Me­Lock provides a low cost and easy to implement solution for preventing this problem.  </p>
